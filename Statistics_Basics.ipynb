It provides a way to map outcomes to numbers for easier mathematical analysis. Random variables can take on different values, depending on the random process or experiment.\n","\n","\n","\n","**Types of Random Variables**\n","\n","\n","\n","1. Discrete Random Variables:\n","\n","\n","- Definition: A random variable is discrete if it can take on a countable number of distinct values.\n","\n","\n","- Key Characteristics:\n","\n","\n","- Values are usually integers.\n","\n","\n","- Can be listed explicitly or counted (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ...).\n","\n","\n","- Examples:\n","\n","\n","- Number of heads in 5 coin tosses.\n","\n","\n","- Number of customers entering a shop in an hour.\n","\n","\n","-Number of defective items in a batch.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Probability Distribution:\n","\n","- Represented by a probability mass function (PMF), which gives the probability of each possible value.\n","\n","\n","Example: Let X represent the number of heads in 3 coin tosses. Possible valuesof X are 0,1,2,3, with corresponding probabilities.\n","\n","\n","\n","2. Continuous Random Variables:\n","\n","\n","\n","- Definition: A random variable is continuous if it can take on an infinite number of possible values within a given range.\n","\n","\n","- Key Characteristics:\n","\n","\n","- Values are not countable but can be measured.\n","\n","\n","\n","- Can take any value within a range (e.g., real numbers).\n","\n","\n","- Examples:\n","\n","\n","- Heights of people in a population.\n","\n","\n","- Time taken to complete a task.\n","\n","\n","- Temperature on a given day.\n","\n","\n","\n","Probability Distribution:\n","\n","- Represented by a probability density function (PDF).\n","\n","\n","-\n","The probability of the random variable taking on an exact value is zero (P(X=x)=0); instead, probabilities are given over intervals.\n","\n","\n","Example: Let Y represent the time (in minutes) it takes for a train to arrive.
